# Self Healing

## Purpose
Diagnose and fix runtime issues (crashes, errors, misconfigurations) with the smallest safe patch.

## Steps

### 1. Inspect the Failing Runtime Surface
- Identify what is failing (process, service, tool, MCP server)
- Check error messages and stack traces
- Check recent changes that may have caused the failure
- Use `codex_knowledge_memory_query` for past similar issues

### 2. Reproduce with Smallest Useful Command
- Find the minimal command that reproduces the failure
- Record the exact reproduction steps
- Verify the failure is consistent (not intermittent)

### 3. Apply the Smallest Safe Fix
- Identify the root cause
- Make the minimal change that fixes it
- Use `minimalist_review_change` to verify the patch is minimal
- Do NOT refactor, optimize, or add features while fixing

### 4. Run Doctor and Validation Checks
- Run the reproduction command to confirm the fix
- Run the full test suite to check for regressions
- Run `cognition_codex_check_aop_consistency` for logical consistency
- Run LSP diagnostics to check for type errors

### 5. Record the Fix
- Use `codex_knowledge_knowledge_capture` to store the fix
- Use `evolution_record_retrospective` if this is a recurring pattern
- Use `evolution_classify_repetition` if the same failure has occurred before
